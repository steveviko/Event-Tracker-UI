# Events Ticket App.
An application called Events Ticket App. The application enables a user to Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD) an event and the users within.I will describe the process I went through while developing the APp. The code lives on Github and you can find it [here](https://steveviko.github.io/level-up-35-sept/).


## Project Overview
This platform allows event planners to easily loop through their guest lists.It completely give event oragnizer the reigns when organizing how they would like to collect check-in information while making the process as stress-free as possible.

## The Initial Folder Struture.
LEVEL-UP-35-SEPT/
                 |-App                    
                 |-images
                 |-reception
                 |-REST-API
                 |-tests
                 |-.gitignore
                 |-index.html
                 |-main.css
                 |-README.md

Above is my initial folder structure with App as the name of the application folder. Within the app folder there are three are signup file,

.images directory where images resides.
.receptions where registration_checker methods exists.
.REST-API contains the logic for carrying CRUD operations on Users
.tests contains test cases for user signup




## Exploring the file structure
 1. The __init__.py file contains the code for setting up the Flask application and registering the different packages   onto the application instance.
 2. The .gitignore file contains the files that should not be added and tracked by the Version Control System(VCS) in this case Git.
 3. The index file contains the User Interface for user interactions
 4. The main css file contains styles to be applied to the index page
 5. The README.md markdown file contains any description or information the developer makes available to the application users.
